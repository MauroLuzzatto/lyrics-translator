Surfin’ USA Lyrics[Verse 1]
If everybody had an ocean
Across the U.S.A
Then everybody'd be surfin'
Like Californi-a
You'd see them wearing their baggies
Huarache sandals too
A bushy bushy blond hairdo
Surfin' U.S.A

[Chorus]
You'd catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Ventura County line
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Santa Cruz and Trestles
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Australia's Narrabeen
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
All over Manhattan
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
And down Doheny Way
(Inside, outside)
[Hook]
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

[Verse 2]
We'll all be planning that route
We're gonna take real soon
We're waxing down our surfboards
We can't wait for June
We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on surfari to stay
Tell the teacher we're surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

[Chorus]
Haggerties and Swamis
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Pacific Palisades
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
San Onofre and Sunset
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Redondo Beach LA
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
All over La Jolla
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
At Wa'imea Bay
(Inside, outside)
[Hook]
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

Yeah everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

Yeah everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A11Embed
